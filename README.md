This Python project focuses on 2 seperate cases Pybank and PyPoll. The task is to show the Financial analysis and Election Results.
mainly written by me, had some assistance with the below image:

PyBank: 
For this example i have search how to keep the last 3 decimal places. Other than that mostly referred back to STUExamples.

used this resource to integrate in my code. 

Also referred back to Zoom materials esp class examples. I didn't use Udemy this time since it's my first time using Panda's with a dataset.
I watched a few videos related to this topic on Youtube primarly "Reading in Files in Pandas | Python Pandas Tutorials".

PyPoll:
In regards to consistent results I had to constantly go back and forth for example:

I had to check the name accurately I couldnt abbreviate, so I had add the full name.
